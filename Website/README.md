# Important info
This folder is just made for this example to mimic the website root folder of your Sitecore instance.

Each mockup html file shows a context - project layer module - that use the generated frontend resources.

_Note: the dist folder contain fonts copied from font-awesome in node_modules. This should be automated in the build process._


_Disclaimer: Do not place your real instance webroot in your solution root folder;_
